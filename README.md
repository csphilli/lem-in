# Lem-In
This program tests the students ability to write a program that accepts a graph and moves ants through paths in the shortest amount of moves as possible.

For this program, I utilized the following:

* A modified Edmonds-Karp algorithm.
* BFS.
* Dynamically sizing hash table data structure.
* Patience...

At the time of this writing, the world is in the grips of a pandemic. Because of that, we have to be digital nomads. And since this program requires us to describe how our program works in depth during the evaluation, I wrote a document for it.
